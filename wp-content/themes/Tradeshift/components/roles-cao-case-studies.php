		<h2>Market Share Gets "Shaved Down"</h2>
		<p>True story: An industry giant is confronted by a newcomer – Dollar Shave Club. Within 2 years Dollar Shave Club had taken over 54% of the ecommerce market share, putting a big dent in the used-to-be industry leader’s potential revenue. Not having the collaborative supplier relationships they needed, “Goliath” was unable to respond, merely watching as their market share slipped away. </p>

		<h2>Profits are saying “bon voyage”...</h2>
		<p>True story: With a valuation that towers over well-established industry giants’, at $25.5 billion, Airbnb is devouring chunks of incumbent’s profits. Brimming with flexibility, agility, and authenticity, Airbnb, and the entire sharing economy, presents a new challenge to the traditional business model. The conversations in the board room are changing. The incumbents, if unable to quickly react to the market shifts, will soon find themselves couch-surfing. </p>

		<h2>Competitive advantage disappears at the “speed of sound”...</h2>
		<p>True story: Hyperloop, the brainchild of Tesla’s Elon Musk, is turning science fiction into reality, able to remove timeline barriers and bring costs down for purchasing and logistics departments, but only if they’re agile enough to take advantage of the hyper competition by connecting to new suppliers to deliver value to stakeholders. And if incumbents aren’t already planning for it now, they better start—generating savings won’t be enough to save this ship from sailing. </p>
